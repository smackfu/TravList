<h1>Page not found</h1>
<p>This is probably not a good thing.  Maybe there's a silver lining but I don't see it.  You can try going <a href="javascript: history.back()">back a page</a> and hitting reload.  Then, if the link you clicked on the first time has <i>mysteriously</i> disappeared from the reloaded page, then... whatever it was got deleted.  Sorry about that.  Hope you didn't think that would really help.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the link is still there and brings you right back here, you probably want that bugs link down below.  Cheers.</p>
